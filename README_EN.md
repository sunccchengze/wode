# MBTI Explorer · scz-mbti-explorer

[简体中文](README.md) | **English**

> An MBTI explorer grounded in **Sun Chengze's own corpus**: a falsifiable evidence ledger that answers “what kind of person am I, why do I do this, and how do I get stronger.”
> Relationship and dating advice is **one application** of it, not the whole thing.

If it helps you spend less time overthinking and make one more clear-headed decision, please consider giving it a 🌟 **Star**.

Most MBTI tools offer only two outcomes: “You are an INTJ” or “Take the test again.” MBTI Explorer tries to do better. It **reads your existing corpus first and only asks questions that would change the conclusion**. It hands you candidates, evidence, counterevidence, and falsification conditions together. It does not turn a type into a destiny, and it does not dress a few sentences up as a fake-precise percentage.

It is not a quiz generator. It maintains a **corpus that keeps growing** (`corpus/`): a personal profile, a growing MBTI evidence ledger, expression DNA, a queue of open questions, and living memory. It also inherits a complete relationship-adviser toolkit — emotional support, chat-log analysis, relationship judgment, and sendable replies — but those are now **applications of personality exploration** rather than the entire product.

> 📌 **Provenance (2026-09-03)**: this repository derives from the relationship adviser `goutoujunshi`
> (upstream [shengjidaguai-china/goutoujunshi](https://github.com/shengjidaguai-china/goutoujunshi), MIT).
> MBTI was promoted from a sub-feature to the trunk, and a personal corpus was built on top.
> See `documentation/仓库体检报告.md` (Chinese) for the full audit.

This is more than a library of scripted replies. It can analyze chat screenshots, exported text, and the user's account of events while preserving evidence boundaries. It can turn analysis into a message ready to send, a specific invitation, a first-date plan, or a conversation exercise that can be reviewed afterward. It is a Codex Skill for the full relationship lifecycle, designed for diverse relationships and capable of explaining the reasoning behind its advice.

## What It Can Help With

| Your situation | How it helps |
| --- | --- |
| You do not know how to reply | Gives you one message you can send immediately, followed by timing and response branches |
| You want to pursue someone, reconnect, ask them out, or move the relationship forward | Provides concrete actions and adjusts the plan based on the other person's response |
| You cannot read the other person or are choosing between multiple people | Combines behavior, MBTI, subjective ratings, and real-world circumstances to give a clear assessment |
| You are unsure of your MBTI type or torn between adjacent types | Uses candidate sets, evidence ledgers, targeted follow-ups, and falsification to produce a revisable conclusion with alternatives—never fake precision from a few messages |
| You want personality-aware communication or growth | Translates four preferences and eight functions into testable language, negotiation patterns, and daily skill practice without claiming that growth means “changing type” |
| The chat history is long or there are too many screenshots | Locks the speaker mapping, separates facts from inferences and unknowns, and can analyze existing ChatLab data |
| **You do not want to repeat the background next time** | **Long-term memory:** after explicit first-time consent, remembers limited profiles and key developments across tasks; updates automatically, recalls only what is needed, and can be viewed, paused, revoked, or cleared at any time |
| You are dealing with distance, conflict, unequal investment, a breakup, or a marriage decision | Acknowledges the emotions, weighs the tradeoffs, and gives a next step, an observation window, and a stopping condition |

## No Assumptions About Who You Should Love

It supports heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual users. It respects transgender, non-binary, and other gender identities. It can discuss single dating, long-term partnerships, marriage, long-distance relationships, remarriage, cross-cultural relationships, and consensual non-monogamy.

The system does not impose fixed gender roles. Users of any gender can take the initiative or choose a highly proactive approach. In common heterosexual dating contexts in China, it may suggest that a man raise his level of initiative by one step when there is no clear rejection or discomfort. This is only a cultural calibration that individual preferences and real-world feedback can override—not a rule that men must pursue while women wait. The assessment always depends on the specific people, their behavior, mutual willingness, and practical circumstances.

## An Interdisciplinary Relationship Knowledge Base

The project maintains relationship science, practical communication guidance, and tool integrations separately, loading only what the current question needs. It covers:

| Area | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Relationship psychology | Attraction and selection, partner responsiveness, social exchange, comparison levels, alternatives, commitment, dependence, power, stress, and repair |
| Personality and emotion | MBTI preferences and cognitive functions, adjacent-type comparison, Big Five cross-checks, communication adaptation, growth practice, attachment, anxiety, and avoidance |
| Meeting and dating | Attraction, expressing interest, first dates, experience design, invitations, defining the relationship, online dating, ghosting, and digital boundaries |
| Communication strategy | Chat-record analysis, situational calibration, three-layer reply design, conversation practice, listening, empathy, compliments, conflict, apologies, refusal, and initiative |
| PUA and social strategy | Blueprint-style inner state, natural flow, cold reading, Mystery-style structure/content/delivery, plus the risks and lower-risk alternatives to negging, push-pull tactics, compliance tests, and gaslighting |
| Sex and intimacy | Ongoing consent, sexual communication, contraception and health boundaries, bodily autonomy, and intimacy negotiation |
| Marriage and family | Premarital agreements, shared finances, housework, parenting, both families of origin, and the family lifecycle |
| Law and safety | Chinese marriage and family law, domestic violence, stalking, fraud, evidence preservation, and crisis referral |
| Society and humanities | The evolution of modern marriage, demographics and urbanization, platform-mediated dating, gendered labor, and care work |
| Philosophy of love | Desire, friendship, freedom, commitment, community, self and other, love, and possession |
| Breakups and special situations | Heartbreak, betrayal, reconciliation, rebuilding trust, diverse relationships, and avoiding stereotypes |

The knowledge base distinguishes stronger research evidence from theoretical frameworks, popular claims, and experience-based tactics. MBTI, attachment styles, and online scripts can inform questions and generate options, but they are never presented as diagnoses, destiny, or guaranteed formulas. Serious MBTI analysis retains competing types, alternative explanations, user corrections, and falsifiers; cognitive-function stacks remain qualitative interview and perspective tools, while safety, consent, reciprocity, values, and observed behavior take priority in relationship decisions.

## Installation

Clone the repository into your Codex Skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunccchengze/scz_MBTI_explorer.git ~/.codex/skills/scz-mbti-explorer
```

Then enter this in Codex:

```text
Use $scz-mbti-explorer to help me process my emotions, assess my current relationship, and decide what to do next.
```

On first use, it will ask for:

```text
You: MBTI / overall rating from 0–100 / main strengths and weaknesses
Person A: alias / MBTI / overall rating from 0–100 / current relationship
Person B (if any): same fields
History: how you met, how long this has developed, key events, contact, and investment
Goal: move forward, define the relationship, repair it, compare options, or leave
Emotion: what hurts most right now, intensity from 0–10, and whether a message needs an immediate reply
```

You can leave unknown fields blank or simply tell the story. The Skill will organize a profile from the narrative and ask only for information that could materially change the advice. If you want to reuse context across tasks, it will separately ask once for permission to store a compact profile locally. Declining does not affect normal use.

### Running a Serious MBTI Analysis

You can say:

```text
Use $scz-mbti-explorer to determine whether ENTJ or INTJ fits me better. Do not give me a quick quiz; retain candidates, evidence, counterevidence, and conditions that would falsify the conclusion.
```

The Skill asks low-friction scenario questions in rounds, maintains an evidence ledger, directly compares adjacent candidates, and treats Big Five traits, roles, culture, and stress as competing explanations. For a long auditable case, `python3 scripts/mbti_case.py init --help` creates a local structure. The script validates the investigation; it does not automatically assign a type.

### Analyzing Exported Chat Files

ChatLab is an optional dependency. After installing it and preparing chat exports that you obtained yourself, you can say:

```text
Use $scz-mbti-explorer with ChatLab to analyze the last three months of chats between me and Person A.
```

It first previews the import plan, then limits queries by conversation, participant, and time range. It does not directly read, decrypt, or export databases from messaging apps. Without ChatLab, you can still paste text or upload screenshots for analysis.

## How a Typical Answer Is Produced

```text
User's account
  → acknowledge the emotion
  → build profiles for the user and each person involved
  → separate facts / inferences / unknowns
  → retrieve only the knowledge needed for the situation
  → compare reciprocity, practical circumstances, risk, and opportunity cost
  → give a clear preferred recommendation with reasons
  → produce actions, wording, an observation window, and stopping conditions
```

Long-term memory and ChatLab are used only when the user consents or supplies the relevant data. They do not change this core analysis flow.

## Design Principles

1. **See the person before solving the problem.** Even correct advice may be impossible to act on when the emotion has not been acknowledged.
2. **Behavior is more reliable than labels.** Do not use MBTI, gender, or a single chat exchange to pretend to read another person's mind.
3. **Reciprocity matters more than winning someone over.** Getting one particular person is not the only victory; reducing emotional drain, preserving dignity, and keeping future options are also valid outcomes.
4. **Every strategy should disclose its cost.** The Skill can discuss affectionate or playful messaging, push-pull dynamics, pacing, and presentation, but it also explains where they fit and what they may cost over time.
5. **Consent and the right to leave cannot be bypassed.** A clear rejection is not an obstacle to overcome.
6. **Safety comes first in dangerous situations.** Violence, coercion, stalking, fraud, and self-harm risk require more than ordinary dating advice.

### Release and Maintenance History

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for complete release notes and compatibility information.

| Date | Type | Update | User value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-06 | Migration and verification | Migrated the 22 unique documents of the discontinued predecessor repo `wendang11` (LoveMaster, last commit 2026-08-12) into this repository: the A1 personality assessment, the MBTI mastery handbook, the three-book distillation (Jung / Myers / Keirsey), 16 "me (INTJ) with type X" briefs, the 10-expert team, the skill charter, 6 original rule files from the turbine project, and a 431-line INTJ visual essay. Added a **number verification ledger** grading all 27 numeric claims by source (A primary / B consistent secondary / C conflicting / D crowdsourced typology lore / E no source found), and relicensed the root from PolyForm Noncommercial to MIT to match upstream. | Fixes the dead citation for evidence source A1, so the owner can safely delete `wendang11` (a complete 152-file / 25.05 MB snapshot already exists in `SCZ_Archived`). No number was deleted, but none can now masquerade as a measurement. Verification caught a real error in the handbook (Big Five correlation strengths stated backwards) and a definition of the Probability Index that diverges from the publisher's official wording. |
| 2026-08-11 | MBTI capability | Added evidence boundaries for preferences and cognitive functions, adaptive typing interviews, evidence ledgers, adjacent-type duels, report quality gates, communication adaptation, growth exercises, multi-perspective simulation, and a structured case-audit tool. | Moves from merely storing a type label to revisable, falsifiable MBTI analysis while preventing fake precision, mind-reading, and “golden pair” claims. |
| 2026-08-03 | Memory and chat analysis | Preserved the previous profile-building, emotional support, relationship assessment, proactive guidance, and immediate reply capabilities; added compact local memory that updates automatically after first-time consent and can be revoked, plus analysis of chat screenshots, exported records, and existing ChatLab data. | Keeps the familiar adviser experience while enabling bounded profiles across tasks, reliable speaker mapping, and relationship-trend analysis; it neither stores full chats nor claims to export messaging-app data directly. |
| 2026-07-23 | Architecture | Reduced `SKILL.md` to a lightweight behavior and routing kernel; added mechanisms, risks, and ethical translations for classic social systems including Blueprint-style inner state, natural flow, cold reading, and Mystery-style structured interaction; changed validation to cover required files, context budget, and runtime boundaries; added allowlisted installation and regression scenarios. | Loads only 1–3 references needed for the current question, retaining practical detail while reducing estimated everyday context cost by 48.3%; installed copies can validate without project documentation, and safeguards prevent misuse of mind-reading, manipulation, and stage escalation. |
| 2026-07-22 | Calibration | Added guidance for expressing interest, first dates, and natural contact; allowed a second proactive attempt after one ambiguous response; added scenario tests and checklist validation. | Encourages appropriate initiative in ordinary dating while preserving a clear stop line for explicit rejection, discomfort, or avoidance. |
| 2026-07-22 | Expansion | Reviewed open-source projects around Tong Jincheng, Fan Gongzi, and relationship-copilot Skills; extracted presentation, situational improvisation, conversational give-and-take, light flirting, and real-time calibration; added seven primary strategies, three-layer reply design, 36 reply patterns, and conversation practice, while updating the capability overview and core workflow. | Does not copy personas or routines. When users ask “How should I reply?”, they first receive one sendable preferred response and can continue based on positive, ambiguous, or rejecting reactions. |
| 2026-07-22 | Improvement | Added support for chat screenshots, exported chat text, and copied instant-message content, distinguishing among chats, user reports, calls, offline interaction, and mixed material. | Continues to organize emotions first, then analyzes verifiable words and behavior without imagining offline events from text chats or presenting inferences as facts. |
| 2026-07-21 | New | Added unequal-investment and graceful-exit modules with event-based observation windows, reduced-investment strategies, and exit language, including same-sex/closeted, long-distance, workplace, consensually non-monogamous, and high-risk scenarios. | Helps users decide whether to keep investing, protect their time and energy, and recognize when to move into a safety-oriented process. |
